## Numerical simulation of complex flows

Nowadays, the combination of modern supercomputers with cutting-edge simulation tools allows to solve very complex problems of technological and scientific interest and, what is more important, the allows to be predictive. The numerical simulation of environmental events, such as atmospheric, oceanic or surface water flows, has come to a point where trustworthy predictions can be done at a reasonable cost, providing quite a realistic picture of the potential threats linked to those events. On the other hand, the rocketing technological growth of the manufacturing industry is demanding the study and resolution of new problems that can be addressed through the same approach.

### Hyperbolic conservation laws

Hyperbolic partial differential equations arise in a broad variety of fields where wave propagation phenomena are dominant, for instance, gas dynamics and acoustics, and there is a branch of CFD that is exclusively focused on such problems. Historically, many of the fundamental ideas were developed in the framework of the compressible Euler equations for gas dynamics by the aerospace community. At present, these methods have been extended to other applications such as free surface flows modeled by the shallow water equations (SWE). As Euler equations, the SWE are nonlinear and their solutions suffer from loss of regularity: solutions that are initially smooth may eventually become discontinuous in the form of shock waves.
