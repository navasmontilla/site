# Numerical simulation of environmental flows


## Short bio

I am Assistant professor in the Department of Science and Technology of Materials and Fluids at the Polytechnical School of Teruel (University of Zaraogoza). My on-going and future research focuses on the development of efficient simulation tools for environmental flows.   


## Teaching

- [Fluid Mechanics](teaching/fluidos.md) (2021-present), at University of Zaragoza
- [Thermodynamics and heat transfer](teaching/termodinamica.md) (2021-present), at University of Zaragoza
- Solid mechanics (2019-2021), at Centro Universitario de la Defensa

I have also supervised several degree projects and master theses. For prospective students, you can find the topics offered [here](test.md).

## Research lines

Nowadays, the combination of modern supercomputers with cutting-edge simulation tools allows to solve very complex problems of technological and scientific interest and, what is more important, it allows to be predictive. The numerical simulation of environmental events, such as atmospheric, oceanic or surface water flows, has come to a point where trustworthy predictions can be done at an affordable cost, providing quite a realistic picture of the potential threats linked to those events. On the other hand, the rocketing technological growth of the manufacturing industry is demanding the study and resolution of new problems that can be addressed through the same approach. You can find my research interests below:

- [Accurate simulation of free surface shallow flows](swe_thesis.md) 

- [Simulation of resonant flows in cavities](test.md)

- [Overcoming numerical shockwave anomalies](anomalies.md) 

- [Evaluation of the spectral properties of numerical schemes](test.md)

- [Hyperbolic hydrology](test.md)

- [Wildfire modelling](test.md)
