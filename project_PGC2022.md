## Abstract

This is a proposal for a non-oriented research project in the area of mathematical modelling, simulation and dynamical analysis of environmental flows. Our goal is to develop mathematical and computational tools to analyze and simulate wildfire events, that improve the understanding of the non-linear dynamical processes involved both in the surface propagation and in the atmospheric dynamics of a wildfire. The scientific results of this research include novel mathematical, numerical and computational tools, e.g. the derivation of novel high-order numerical solvers, which can be of interest to a broad public working on computational fluid dynamics, earth-system modelling, applied mathematics and dynamical system analysis.

## Objectives

- Development of a methodology for the estimation of the energy content of seiche waves using water surface data.
- Application of a high-resolution shallow water solver to reproduce the resonant flow in a channel with lateral cavities in a wide a range of hydraulic conditions of physical relevance.
- Assesment of the energy content of the seiche in the cases reproduced in the previous points.
- Generation of 2D seiche amplitude and energy maps.
